                    At the center of the Math WebGame page, there's a container consisting of
                    a math problem, a number field in which the player can enter their answer, and
                    a button the player clicks to submit their answer. Also, there's a timer which
                    ends the game when it expires, so they should answer each question as quickly
                    as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The player's score starts at 0 points. If the player answers a question correctly,
                    their score will increase by 10 points. Otherwise, their score will decrease by 5 points.
                    Note that there's a multiplier which increases by 1 if the player answers a question
                    correctly and decreases by 1 otherwise. The multiplier multiplies its number by 5 points
                    and adds the result to the player's score. (For example, if the player's current score is 10
                    and the multiplier is 4x, then the score will be 50 if they answered the current question
                    correctly.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the timer expires,
